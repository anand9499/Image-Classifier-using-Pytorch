# Image-Classifier-using-Pytorch

## Description
This project involves the implementation of an image classification application using a deep learning model on a dataset of images.The trained model will then be used to classify new images .GPU processing is recommended for this project.

Part 1 of the project involves implementing an image classifier that is trained on a flower data set . There are 102 different types of flowers, where there are approximately 20 images per flower to train upon

Part2 involves converting the notebook into a python application that can be run from the command line to train a neural network and use it to make predictions

## Dataset Used
If flower dataset is used, download/extract/place the image dataset download [link](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) in the following folder structure:
        
        project
          |-- codes
          |-- data
               |--- train
                    |-- class 1
                        |-- images of class 1
                    |-- class 2
                        |-- images of class 2
                    |-- etc
               |-- valid
                    |-- class 1
                        |-- images of class 1
                    |-- class 2
                        |-- images of class 2
                    |-- etc
               |-- test
                    |-- class 1
                        |-- images of class 1
                    |-- class 2
                        |-- images of class 2
                    |-- etc
                    
                    
If other images are used, place them in the same folder structure as above.
